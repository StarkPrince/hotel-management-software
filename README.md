# Hotel Management Software 

  

## Getting Started

  

### Prerequisites

  

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed:

  

-  **Node.js** (v16 or later)

-  **npm** (v7 or later)

-  **PostgreSQL** (recommended for the database)

  

### Installation

  

1.  **Clone the repository:**

  

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/starkprince/hotel-management-software.git
	cd hotel-management-software
	```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
This will install the dependencies for the entire TurboRepo workspace (both client and server):
	```bash
	npm install
	```

3.  **Set up the database using Prisma:**
Ensure that PostgreSQL is running. You can set it up locally or use a cloud provider. Run the following command to apply database migrations:
	```bash
	npx prisma generate
	npx prisma migrate dev
	```
4.  **Access the application:**
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to access the frontend client application.
The backend server should be running on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/), handling API requests.


---  

## Architecture
  

-  **Client**: The frontend application using Next.js.

-  **Server**: The backend API built with Fastify.

  

These services are under apps whose build is managed by Turborepo which help improve build times and manage monorepos.
  

### Services Overview

  

#### **Client Service** (Frontend)

- Built with **Next.js** for server-rendered React applications.

- Uses **TailwindCSS** for styling and **React Hook Form** for form management.

- The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs.

  

#### **Server Service** (Backend)

- Built with **Fastify** for fast and scalable server-side APIs.

-  **Prisma** ORM for database interactions (PostgreSQL).

-  **Next-auth** for authentication and user management.

- The backend provides REST APIs consumed by the client service.

## Final Folder Structure

  

With the move to TurboRepo and microservices, the project structure has changed as follows:

  

```

‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /web # Frontend service (Next.js)
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /src
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /server # Backend service (Fastify)
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /src
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /node_modules # Dependencies for the entire repo
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /shared # Shared utilities or components (if any)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json # Root-level dependencies and scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore

## Troubleshooting

  

-  **Database not connected**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and properly configured. Check `.env` for correct connection strings.

-  **Prisma migrations failing**: Ensure that Prisma CLI can connect to the database. Check the `.env` file for the database URL and ensure PostgreSQL is accessible.
